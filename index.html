                BIOLOGICAL SELF

            <h4>
                For the Biological Self, the biggest learning I’ve gained is the learning I’ve gained from human instinct especially in sexuality.
        
                Especially reading the assigned paper It was very enlightening and led me to learn more about the differences in the dynamics of gender

                    The Physical and Sexual
                </h3>
                <h5>
                    Through Activities like the MEvolution and the assigned readings, I got to find out my own physical and sexual aspects.
                    I understood the physical traits fairly easily and grasped the concept of growing and maturing through different environments.
                    What’s more interesting to me is the discussion on the sexual self, where we found out, through case studies as well the intricacies and diversity of sexuality and gender.

                From the material from the social self I've pondered how I am part of the social world, and the role of my "self" in it. 
                Particularly, I was intrigued in the distinction, the vast distinction, of the me with myself, and the me with other people, and I've come to know now how both of those are distinct, yet are still part of my own self.

                    The biggest thing I've drawn from the cultural self is the diversity of how we percieve the social world. I am especially   intrigued in how different cultures instill different values when raising their youth.

                    For the material on the Digital self, I can relate wholeheartedly. I've finally concretely describe how the interent has shaped my communication, and differences in my behaviour there. From the anonimity, the power of my voice because of that, and how I see other people there.

How we percieve items to be significant, while aware, I've found their real significance now. I now know why consumerism and materialistic values manifest, and why they are important.

                    From this unit, I learned about how I process information and the different ways I see, and handle information, and situations in which I use my intelligence to handle problems. I found out I'm more of a visual learner, who for the most part is analytical, but can be experential.
