        Biological Self
    </h2>
    <h4>
        For the Biological Self, the biggest learning I’ve gained is the learning I’ve gained from human instinct especially in sexuality.

        Especially reading the assigned paper It was very enlightening and led me to learn more about the differences in the dynamics of gender

    <h3>
        The Physical and Sexual
    </h3>
    <h5>
        Through Activities like the MEvolution and the assigned readings, I got to find out my own physical and sexual aspects.
        I understood the physical traits fairly easily and grasped the concept of growing and maturing through different environments.
        What’s more interesting to me is the discussion on the sexual self, where we found out, through case studies as well the intricacies and diversity of sexuality and gender.
